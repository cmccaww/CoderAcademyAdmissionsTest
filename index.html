  <h3> What did you find most challenging about this test? </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> Where I was meant to change the code i.e. when to use terminal, github, or visual studio. 
    The clone repo link didn't work so I didn't know if I was cloning to github or my computer. </p>

  <hr>

  <h3> Are there any parts of the test you could not complete? (This is OK, just include notes about what happened in
    your submission) </h3>
  <p class="paragraph-four"> This >>> "In your terminal, from the project folder (which should be your current location) 
    type ‘​code .’​and this should open visual studio with your code. The rest of this test will be about making changes 
    to these files."
    <br>and this >>> "Right click, or double click on the ​index.html​file in the left-hand section where the file system is 
    displayed, and chose ‘​copy path​’." the path wouldn't copy. Just the title would. 
    <br>Also the instructions say 'get rid of all styling for the paragraphs in the css', then tell you 
    to copy the styling from paragraph 3 (that you just deleted?) &#1F937;
